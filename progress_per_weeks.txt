w1
- literature review - using the method for something practical 
- list of relevant literature exploring what has been done since the release of octo/vla/robocat

franka arm documentation 
- building libfranka 
- franka-py library - version robot version 5.5.0'  libfranka 0.13.3
- install real time operating system 
- panda.py 13.3

w2
- interfacing with he arm using the libraries 
- first gripping of an object, making sure that the robot is controllable from the panda_py interface 
- using the 3D space mouse for control 
- setting the bounding boxes of the robot movement 
- implmentation of the camera / gripper logs 

w3
- logging first trajectories -> using the proper data format suited for the models (RLDS format)
- mp4 file with the camera frames
- could take avg in the timestamps to allign the indices  (resampling)
- save data at high rate then for the traiining set for fine tuning we can resample to track wgar we want  
- keyboard control - left/right mouse to use the gripper dynamically - move gripper to close it a little bit 
- separate thread? (useful in the future)
- start collecting trajectories 
- combine the wrist and base cameras for octo / vla is only external
