w1
- literature review - using the method for something practical 
- list of relevant literature exploring what has been done since the release of octo/vla/robocat

franka arm documentation 
- building libfranka 
- franka-py library - version robot version 5.5.0'  libfranka 0.13.3
- install real time operating system 
- panda.py 13.3

w2
- interfacing with he arm using the libraries 
- first gripping of an object, making sure that the robot is controllable from the panda_py interface 
- using the 3D space mouse for control 
- setting the bounding boxes of the robot movement 
- implmentation of the camera / gripper logs 

w3
- logging first trajectories -> using the proper data format suited for the models (RLDS format)
    Examples for RLDS format with franka and panda
      https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/robosuite_panda_pick_place_can
      https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cmu_franka_exploration_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds
      https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/nyu_franka_play_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds

- mp4 file with the saved camera frames
- take avg in the timestamps to allign the indices  (resampling)
- save data at high rate then for the training set
- keyboard control - left/right mouse to use the gripper dynamically - move gripper to close it a little bit 
- separate thread? (useful in the future)
- start collecting first 50 pick and place trajectories 
- combine the wrist and base cameras for octo / vla is only external 

w4 
- rlds format check for the data - make sure that all of the  data formatting requirements for fine tuning are completed 
- finetuning octo-small on the collected trajectories 
- using the university clusters 
- rlds data format checks for submission to the open-x embodiment in the future - once the data is functioning for finetuning the models 
    - will be necessary to collect more high quality data in novel environments along with a variety of tasks 
- folder with subfolders with trajectories, no longer colelcting raw data
