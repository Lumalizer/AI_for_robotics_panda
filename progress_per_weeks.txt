# mp4 file with the camera frames
# could take avg in the timestamps to allign the indices  (resampling)
# save data at high rate then for the traiining set for fine tuning we can resample to track wgar we want  
# keyboard control - left/right mouse to use the gripper dynamically - move gripper to close it a little bit 
## separate thread? (useful in the future)
# start collecting trajectories 
# combine the wrist and base cameras for octo / vla is only external
